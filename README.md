# D

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of various different D scripts, snippets, and programs.

## Explanation
D is a systems programming language created by Walter Bright in 2001. It was designed to be a modern, efficient, and safe programming language that could replace older languages like C and C++. The language includes features like garbage collection, automatic memory management, and support for functional programming paradigms.

D is a compiled language, which means that code written in D is translated into machine-readable instructions by a compiler. It also supports inline assembly code, which allows developers to write low-level code when necessary.

One of the unique features of D is its support for compile-time code execution, which allows developers to write code that is evaluated at compile-time rather than run-time. This can be used to generate optimized code, perform compile-time type checks, and more.

Overall, D is a powerful language that can be used for a variety of applications, including system programming, game development, and web development. It has a growing community of developers and is actively maintained by the D Language Foundation.
